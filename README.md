## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

- The HTML contains a static structure with placeholders for the review.
- On page load, JavaScript replaces the placeholder content with the first review from the `reviews` array.
- The **Next** and **Prev** buttons cycle through the list of reviews.
- The **Surprise Me** button shows a random review.
